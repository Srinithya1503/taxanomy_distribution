if you have downloaded the genome information of a bulk number of species, let's say of a phylum from NCBI genome browser and now you want to see the taxonomy distribution of each of them. you can achieve this by following these:
1) download the rankedlineage.dmp file from NCBI taxonomy browser.
2)using shell script i have uploaded  "extraction.sh", the required taxonomy distribution would be achieved as in the output file "taxa_696_dataset.tsv"
